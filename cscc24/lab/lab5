'''
Learning objective:
study Python's functional features

We go back to our previous lab, where we practised using higher
order procedures in Scheme. We will re-implement some of the functions
from that lab in Python3.  Once again, we will use lists and lists of
lists to represent vectors and matrices.

Now that you are familiar with the style, albeit in a different
language, it is up to you to find suitable higher order functions or
other funcitonal constructs to use in your solutions.

You should begin by looking at what's available. For example:
  -- generator expressions
  -- list comprehensions
  -- map, reduce, filter, zip, any, all, ...

You will probably need to use zip for most of your solutions.

Finally, as always, make sure your code passes pep8 and pyint.
